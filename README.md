![Research ChatBot](./Research_Chatbot.jpg)

The Research ChatBot addresses two key challenges in AI-powered chat systems: it uses real-time data for up-to-date information and removes word limit constraints. Developed with Python, Streamlit, and Langchain, it processes news articles, splits text, creates embeddings, and answers questions effectively.

## Features

- **URL Processing**: Input up to three news article URLs for analysis.
- **Text Splitting**: The tool automatically splits text data into manageable chunks.
- **Embeddings**: Create embeddings using OpenAI's GPT-3 or another model from Hugging Face Transformers.
- **Question-Answering**: Ask questions about the content of the articles and receive answers with sources.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key.

## Usage

1. Start the app by running `streamlit run main.py`.
2. Input the URLs of the news articles you want to analyze.
3. Click the "Process URLs" button to begin the analysis.
4. Enter your questions in the input box and receive answers with sources.

## Dependencies

- Python
- Streamlit
- Langchain
- Hugging Face Transformers (for alternative model usage)
